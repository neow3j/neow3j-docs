# Smart Contract Development

Neo stands out from other blockchains in that it allows you to implement smart contracts in several well known
programming languages like C#, Go and JavaScript. Neow3j contributes to this and adds support for Java as a smart
contract language. The part of neow3j concerned with smart contract development is termed **neow3j devpack**. 
It is composed of three modules.

- The `io.neow3j:devpack` is the module that your smart contract project will depend on. It is a Java library that
  contains Neo-specific annotations, methods, and classes required for contract development. You will use it in your
  contract, e.g., to fetch information about the current block, or to send out a notification. The API of this module is
  described in the [Devpack](neo-n3/smart_conract_development/devpack.md) section.  
- The `io.neow3j:compiler` contains the compiler that produces NeoVm code from Java classes. You can use it 
  programmatically, by invoking it in a Java program, but, most likely you will not need to access it directly.
- The `io.neow3j:gradle-plugin` implements a Gradle plugin that you apply to your smart contract project and offers a
  simple Gradle task for contract compilation

## Java for the Neo Virtual Machine

It is important to understand that, even though, on the surface you will be writing Java code, the generated bytecode 
and the executing virtual machine are not related to Java. Your smart contract code is compiled to byte code that runs
on the Neo Virtual Machine (NeoVM) and not on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Because of the differences between the JVM
and the NeoVM, the programming experience with Java for Neo is different. We, therefore, define Java for Neo as a Java
flavour or subset and name it NeowJava. Section [NeowJava](neo-n3/smart_contract_development/neowjava.md) discusses
in which ways NeowJava deviates from Java and what the pitfalls are when using NeowJava.

## Development Environment 

You can write smart contracts in any editor or IDE you want, but there are some environments, namely Visual Studio Code
and IntelliJ IDEA, that provide you with extra support for an improved developer experience.  

With [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) you can make use of the [Neo Blockchain
Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngd-seattle.neo-blockchain-toolkit) extension, that is
developed by [ngdenterprise](https://ngdenterprise.com/). It allows contract debugging, easy contract setup, and
provides a GUI for manipulating a local neo-express instance.  Next to the Toolkit, we suggest to install the [Java
Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) and the [Gradle Extension
Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=richardwillis.vscode-gradle-extension-pack).

[**IntelliJ**](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) is obviously a good choice because it has already great support
for Java.  A [Neo plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17195-neo) has been implemented for IntelliJ too. It
provides basic control over neo-express via IntelliJ's UI. For usage instructions and a short video visit the plugin's 
[github page](https://github.com/irshadnilam/intellij-neo). Debugging smart contracts is not possible with IntelliJ.


## Requirements

- A local installation of the [**Java 8 SDK**](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) (or higher) is required for smart contract
  compilation. 

- For running smart contract tests you need to have [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed locally.
