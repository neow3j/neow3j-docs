## Smart Contract API

Neo's smart contract API provides methods to retrieve blockchain information, access a contract's
storage area, and interact with the execution environment in which a contract is run.
The API is documented in the official [Neo
documentation](https://docs.neo.org/v3/docs/en-us/reference/scapi/fw/dotnet/neo.html). Neow3j
provides smart contract developers access to the API via the devpack (`io.neow3j:devpack`).
